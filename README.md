### Hi, I'm Imam Ramdhani 👋

I am currently building my path as a **Data Analyst**.

Instead of waiting for college, I decided to upskill myself through intensive courses and practical projects. I enjoy digging into datasets, cleaning them up, and finding insights that actually make sense.

**My Current Focus:**
I'm building my portfolio to prove that practical skills drive results. I work mainly with **SQL (MySQL)** for querying and **Excel** (PivotTables, Lookups) for analysis.

🛠 **What I Can Do:**
* **SQL:** Solving case studies with Joins, Aggregations, and filtering.
* **Excel:** Creating dashboards and analyzing trends using PivotTables.
* **Visualization:** Presenting data clearly to stakeholders using Excel Charts.

📂 **Recent Work:**
* **[Danny's Diner SQL Case Study](https://github.com/Imam-Data/SQL-Case-Study-Dannys-Diner)**: Solving restaurant business problems using SQL (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions).
* **Sales Dashboard**: Analyzing sales performance (Coursera Project).

I am currently open to **Junior Data Analyst** or **Admin** roles where I can apply my skills and learn from a team.
