👋 Junior Data Analyst
I Clean Data So You Can Trust It

Let’s be honest. Most raw data is a mess. I’m the person who actually enjoys fixing it.

I spend my time diving into chaotic datasets, cleaning them up, and making sure they’re truly ready for analysis. My goal is simple: when you look at a report, you shouldn’t have to second-guess the numbers behind it.

How I Work

Most of my heavy lifting happens in SQL (MySQL). I’m comfortable writing queries with CTEs, window functions, and complex joins to answer real business questions.

When Excel is the right tool, I use it properly. From untangling messy text-to-columns issues to building PivotTables and clean dashboards that actually make sense.

For me, data integrity isn’t optional. If the data is shaky, the insights are useless, and I don’t move forward until the numbers can be trusted.
